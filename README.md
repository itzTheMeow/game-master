# Magic
In this world everything has magic, magic is the life force that surrounds you, I, and a deer. Magic naturally protects you even if you don't know it does. Magic comes from many sources and it's possible to make your own.<br>
Magic originated in this world from four primal sources:
- Fire
- Water
- Earth 
- Wind

But that isn't the only magic in the world, certain races are capable of wielding specifc magic. These are known as Inherited Magic.<br>
Iyasha demons are capable of using duality magics.
Members of the Demon and Angel clan use Dark and Light Magic respectively.
Magic can also be man-made.<br>
Coming back to Inherited Magics, they include:
- Blood Magic
- PSI
- Shadow Magic
- Healing Magic
- Protective Magic

Magic comes in 3 forms, Offensive Magic, Defensive Magic, and Utility Magic.
Defensive Magic is always active if your Magic points are above 10. (certain races can't defend themselves from magic) Defensive Magic can be strengthened to defend yourself better.<br>
Offensive magic of the opposite type degrade defensive magic better.<br>
Utility Magic helps in working, healing, and matter manipulation.<br>
Every Magic aside from Shadow, PSI, and Dark Magic can't heal.
Every Primal Magic has it's opposite.
- Fire > Water
- Water > Earth
- Earth > Wind
- Wind > Fire

When Light and Dark magic clash, both take 2x the damage. Magics don't defend against physical damage, but if a sword has a fire enchant, the fire will be treated as a fire spell.

### Using Magic
Using Magic requires MP, aswell as Magic Mastery, and points in the magic stat. Having points in the Magic stat increases the strength of all your magic. As well as increasing your magic points and decreasing your magic costs. Using magics or training in magics allow you to decrease the magic costs of that specific magic.
*More to be Explained*

### Magic Affinity
Races that can use Magic choose a specifc type of magic affinity, they can choose from the 4 primal magics, Pyromancy (Fire), Cryomancy (Water), Aeromancer (Air) , Varismancer (Earth), depending on your affinity you gain accsess to specific spells from the start aswell as a magic defense boost when defending with that magic and defending from that magic, aswell as offensive magics are stronger and more potent. Demon and Angel clan members have two affinitys one for their respective race and one of their choice. High Breeds can choose the affinity of light or dark along with a primal magic.

### Ather Weapons
Every race that can use magic can use Ather Weapons. Weapons derived purely from one's magic and their magic strength.
One can summon an Ather Weapon when they have a 100 in a fighting style. Races that can use claws are capable of using Ather Claws.

# Combat
When Combat begins, you have X amount of turns. The amount of turns is based on your dexterity.<br>
You are given one minute per turn but can queue up your turns. So you are able to queue up a fireball for turn one, a sword slash for turn two, and a ice spike for turn 3.<br>
Depending on your dexterity, and the enemies dexterity, the turns can take a specific rotation. You will be informed of the turn rotation.
A player is able to target specific armor spots and body parts aswell.
Your chance of hitting a target are determined by many stats, Eyesight, your targets dodge stat, and the light level.<br>
*More to be Explained*

# Equipment & Gear
Equipment and Gear are what you wear and carry.
Every Race has differnet Equipment slots but most follow this setup:

### Gear Weight 
Gear Weight determines combat points, dodge chances, attack speed, and weapon preperation speed

# Abilites
Abilites are race specific actions or aquired actions from gear you have.
Things like picking locks, sneaking, flight, and far sight.

# Doungen Crawling

Doungens are randomly generated structures, this is because of the reality bending power of the Doungen Crystal.
 Every Doungen has a Doungen Crystal. Getting to that Crystal will reward you with many riches based on your level.
Every Doungen is different, however most will follow a theme based on the Doungen type. You are more likely to find a fire monster in a fire doungen, then you are likely to find a water monster in a fire doungen.
Most Doungens are very dark so you'll need to have a soure of light to see.

# Camping!
Camping is an intergral part of the survival aspect of the game. When you're injured you can use a medical tent to heal.
When you need to cook you can use a fire spit.
When you need to craft you can use the multiple crafting tents.
Sleeping in a tent can help you heal, increase the amount of sleep you get per minute.
For each member of your party you must have a tent. 
Tents vary and all have uses.



# Dying, Incapacitation, and Critical States
When you're hit with an attack that is meant to be fatal. You will be reduced to 2hp. 
This is known as a critical state. If you're then hit again, you'll be incapacitated. If you have a party member who wins the fight.
You'll be carried to saftey by the strongest capable fighter. In this state you are incapacitated and can't move on your own.
The only way to heal at that point is to be healed by a doctor with medicine in a medical tent.
Now if you don't have a party member and you're reduced to 0hp you will be respawned at the last city you were in.
